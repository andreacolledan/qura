QuRA is a static analysis tool for the resource consumption of quantum algorithms described in PQ.

PQ is a quantum circuit description language that features a rich type-and-effect system, which allows programmers to include quantitative information regarding the resource requirements of a program in its type. Then, if the program type-checks in QuRA, we know for certain that it will not consume more resources than specified.

[Official documentation](https://qura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

**Disclaimer:** support for resource metrics other than circuit width is still experimental.


## Installing
**Note:** QuRA requires [cvc5](https://cvc5.github.io) to be installed and present in your `PATH`.

You can build and install QuRA using [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/) by running

```
git clone https://github.com/andreacolledan/qura
cd qura
stack install
```

### VSCode Support

Syntax highlighting for PQ is available as a [VSCode extension](https://github.com/andreacolledan/vscode-pq-syntax-highlighting).

## Usage
To analyze program `file.pq`, simply run
```
qura file.pq
```
This runs standard type inference for `file.pq`, without any resource analysis. In order to perform global resource metric estimation, use the `-g METRIC` option. For example, to perform width estimation, run

```
qura file.pq -g width
```
To perform local metric estimation, use the `-l METRIC` option instead. Note that at most one global metric and on local metric can be analyzed at a time.

Currently, QuRA supports the analysis of the following circuit size metrics:

| Flag | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| width | Global | How many individual wires (qubits and bits) required to execute the circuit |
| qubits | Global | How many individual qubits required to execute the circuit  | Global |
| bits | Global | How many individual bits required to execute the circuit
| gatecount | Global | How many gates the circuit is made of
| tcount | Global | How many T gates are in the circuit |
| depth | Local | The maximum number of gates occurring on a path from any input to the wire segment under analysis
| tdepth | Local | The maximum number of T gates occurring on a path from any input to the wire segment under analysis

Use option `--debug DEBUG` to dump a copy of all SMT queries performed during typechecking to file `DEBUG`.

General usage of qura is thus
```
qura FILE [-v | --verbose] [-d | --debug DEBUG] [-g | --global-metric-analysis METRIC] [-l | --local-metric-analysis METRIC]
```
For more information, refer to `qura --help`.
